A scientific calculator project can involve designing and building a calculator that can solve math, engineering, and science problems. The project can be done using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, or Android Studio. 
Project details
Design: Create a layout for the calculator using HTML and CSS. 
Input: Add buttons for numbers, operations, and special constants. 
Math: Use a math library to evaluate expressions and implement trigonometric functions. 
Error handling: Add error handling to display messages when expressions are invalid. 
Display: Connect the display to the circuit board using a wire and cover it with a cover. 
User interface: Add buttons, input fields, and text to make the calculator user-friendly. 
Programming: Use JavaScript functions to manage button clicks and update the display. 
Purpose
Scientific calculators are used in education and professional settings to solve math, engineering, and science problems. 
Other considerations
In higher education, graphing calculators are sometimes used instead of scientific calculators. 
Mechanical calculators were invented in the Renaissance by Wilhelm Schickard and Blaise Pascal.
